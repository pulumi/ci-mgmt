        Please provide us with a minimal, self-contained Pulumi program that reproduces this behavior so that
        we can investigate on our end. Without a functional reproduction, we will not be able to prioritize this bug.
        If relevant, please also provide us with the output of 
        `pulumi up --logtostderr --logflow -v=10` from the root of your project.
        **Note:** If the program and/or log output is more than a few lines, please send us a Gist or a link to a file.
